## Final Project Part 1 - Proposal
Outline
I am interested in showing that offshore oil and gas is a good alternative to fracking in shale formations. 
There is interest from high profile Presidential candidates in banning fracking.
While this is a highly charged political talking point - a mature discussion of creating options for long term solutions is necessary.
There is a lack of understanding of the oil and gas industry from a technical standpoint, a lack of acknowledgement of how the industry is connected to the rest of the real economy, and an incomplete discussion around how to transition to an energy mix more reliant on alternative energy.
Discuss oilfields in the North Sea and the use/adoption of alternative energy in those countries
They likely have very little onshore oil and gas activity in their country and have a great safety record
Discuss how building up the offshore industry leads to building up the capability for offshore wind installations
One of the big uses of natural gas (from fracking) is to produce electricity - offset this with offshore wind farms
Was the Deepwater Horizon a catastrophe? Yes absolutely. The loss of life was the worst part. But put the economic and environmental damage in perspective with what is anticipated for global warming. I bet the $60B that BP paid is small potatoes and there is surely a number for the economic cost somewhere. 

Story Arc
Setup - we use a lot of oil and gas. Cars, petrochemicals, plastics. We have a lot of oil and gas activity as a result.
Conflict - political pressures to ban fracking, eliminate fossil fuels and adopt renewable energy sources.
Resolution - minimize immediate health and environmental impact by shifting to more offshore wells, develop capacity and infrastructure to build out offshore wind projects

Call to action: encourage the development of offshore oil and gas when available, as it serves the needs of the country and the planet.
